[Fact:Assembler code]
There are quite a few text messages in the code, like "Stack overflow, try more P switches",
"Fatal error(s)" and "REPT/IRP/IRPC/MACRO".

These appear to come from ASM.COM:
  https://www.iee.et.tu-dresden.de/~kc-club/09/RUBRIK23.HTM
which is a CP/M assembler, and was presumably used to build
the production binary.

[Fact:No use of alternate registers]
The code doesn't use the Z80's alternate register set. There is no EXX or EX AF,AF'
anywhere in it.
